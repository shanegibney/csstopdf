# css to PDF

Working example on [gh-pages](http://shanegibney.github.io/csstopdf/)

This repo is an attempt to convert an SVG element in a simple HTML DOM to PDF.

However the issue is that the styles of the SVG element are not being preserved.

The particular style of interest is,

```style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;"```
